## Encryption Algorithm
SHA-256 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm. A cryptographic hash (sometimes called 'digest') is a kind of 'signature' for a text or a data file. SHA-256 generates an almost-unique 256-bit (32-byte) signature for a text.

## Nonce
In cryptography, a nonce is an arbitrary number that can be used just once. It is similar in spirit to a nonce word, hence the name. It is often a random or pseudo-random number issued in an authentication protocol to ensure that old communications cannot be reused in replay attacks. They can also be useful as initialization vectors and in cryptographic hash functions. Also known as a 'Crypto Nonce'.
